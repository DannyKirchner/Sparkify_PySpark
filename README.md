# Sparkify_PySpark
Predict user churn


### Project motivation:


### Installation:

If following libraries aren't installed already, run "pip install <package_name>" in your command line.

-pyspark

-pandas

-matplotlib

-seaborn  <strong> Due probably updating issues it is possible that seaborn doesn't work completely. Therefore, I included an install command to ensure it executes all neccesary functions, objects, etc...</strong>

-time

-datetime


### File description:

#### Data
Because of github's upload size constraint, I have split the json data into 6 single files. In order to run the app, follow these steps.
1. Create new file and name it "mini_sparkify_event_data.json"
2. Copy the content of the singles files into "mini_sparkify_event_data.json" by ascending order.

#### Code
"Sparkify.py" contains all the necessary code to run the app.


### Conclusion:
